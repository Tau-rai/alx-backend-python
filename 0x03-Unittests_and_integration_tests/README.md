## Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on individual components or functions within your codebase. Here are some key points about unit tests:

- **Purpose**: To verify that each unit (e.g., a function, class, or module) behaves correctly in isolation.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Isolated: Unit tests should not rely on external services, databases, or other components.
  - Fast: They execute quickly, allowing frequent testing during development.
  - Granular: Each test targets a specific piece of functionality.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use testing frameworks (e.g., `unittest` in Python) to write and organize unit tests.
  - Mock external dependencies (e.g., APIs, databases) to isolate the unit being tested.

## Integration Tests

Integration tests validate interactions between different parts of your application. Here's what you need to know:

- **Purpose**: To ensure that various components work together as expected.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Involve multiple units or modules.
  - May interact with databases, APIs, or other external services.
  - Slower than unit tests due to their broader scope.
- **Implementation**:
  - Set up test environments that mimic production conditions.
  - Test real interactions (e.g., database queries, API calls).
  - Use assertions to verify expected behavior.

## Common Testing Patterns

### 1. Mocking

- **Purpose**: To simulate external dependencies during testing.
- **Usage**:
  - Replace real objects (e.g., database connections, network requests) with mock objects.
  - Use libraries like `unittest.mock` (Python) to create mocks.
  - Verify that interactions with mocks occur as expected.

### 2. Parametrization

- **Purpose**: To run the same test with different input data.
- **Usage**:
  - Decorate test functions with parameters.
  - Test various scenarios by providing different input values.
  - Helps catch edge cases and improve test coverage.

### 3. Fixtures

- **Purpose**: To set up and tear down common resources for tests.
- **Usage**:
  - Create reusable fixtures (e.g., database connections, test data).
  - Use decorators or context managers to apply fixtures to test functions.
  - Clean up resources after tests complete.

## Conclusion

Testing is crucial for maintaining code quality and preventing regressions. By understanding unit tests, integration tests, and testing patterns, you'll be better equipped to write robust and reliable code.
