# Asyncio and Random Module in Python
This document provides a brief explanation of the concepts covered in this reposistory.

## Async and Await Syntax
The `async` and `await` keywords are used in Python to work with asynchronous code. The `async` keyword is used to declare a function as a coroutine, which can be paused and resumed, allowing other code to run during the pauses. The `await` keyword is used to wait for the result of a coroutine.

```python
async def my_coroutine():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
```

## Executing an Async Program with Asyncio
To execute an async program with asyncio, you need to create an event loop, and then run your top-level coroutine using this event loop.

```python
async def main():
    print('Hello')
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print('World')

# Python 3.7+
asyncio.run(main())
```

## Running Concurrent Coroutines
You can run multiple coroutines concurrently using the `asyncio.gather()` function.

```python
async def main():
    task1 = asyncio.create_task(coroutine1())
    task2 = asyncio.create_task(coroutine2())
    await asyncio.gather(task1, task2)
```

## Creating Asyncio Tasks
Tasks are used to schedule coroutines concurrently. When a coroutine is wrapped into a Task with functions like `asyncio.create_task()`, the coroutine is automatically scheduled to run soon.

```python
async def my_coroutine():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)

task = asyncio.create_task(my_coroutine())
```

## Using the Random Module
The `random` module in Python is used to generate random numbers. You can use various functions such as `random.randint()` to get a random integer, `random.random()` to get a random float between 0 and 1, or `random.choice()` to get a random element from a list.

```python
import random

print(random.randint(1, 10))  # Random integer between 1 and 10
print(random.random())  # Random float between 0 and 1
print(random.choice(['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']))  # Random element from a list
```
```
```
